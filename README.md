# Sentim-TA

This repository contains a minimal implementation of the **CNN-TA** model for technical indicator based trading. The project has been simplified to focus solely on finance data without any sentiment inputs or additional experimental models.

Training is performed using ``train.py`` which reads price indicator CSV files from ``data_finance``. Adjust paths and hyperparameters in ``config.py`` as needed.
